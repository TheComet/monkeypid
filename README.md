How to build
-----------------
This project uses the [Gradle](https://gradle.org/) build system. Most IDEs such as [Eclipse](https://eclipse.org/) or [IntelliJ](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/) have support for importing gradle projects.

The easiest method is to build it from the command line. cd to the project's root directory (where this README file resides) and execute:
```
./gradlew run
```
If you are using a Windows computer, you can run:
```
gradlew.bat run
```
Gradle will take care of fetching dependencies and building the project from there.
